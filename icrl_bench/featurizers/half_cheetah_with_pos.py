"""Featurizers for HalfCheetahWithPos, one per network input of Malik's
(commit f28214e):
- featurize: the clipped observation and the clipped action, as his
  ConstraintNet.prepare_data builds them (icrl/constraint_net.py) with his
  HCWithPos settings (no normalisation, --clip_obs 20). Maximum Entropy,
  Binary Classifier.
- featurize_raw: the same columns unclipped, as his GailDiscriminator builds
  them (icrl/gail_utils.py: its normalize_obs body and clip_actions call are
  commented out). GACL (docs/decisions.md, 2026-11-01).
His networks then keep only some of these columns, by a bug; that is a
method setting (input_columns), not the featurizer's job."""
